\section{Introduction}
This Thesis deals with the propagation methods for clustering and community structue in
Graphs.
The original motivation is to find application
of these methods on Protein-Protein Interaction Networks (PPI) specifically for
function annotations.

We are given an (in my case undirected) connected graph, which represents some sort of
network structure, be it a PPI or A social network. Real world networks tend to
have some characteristics that are clearly not random, such as the 'small world
property' and tendency to forming hubs. 


\section{The Propagation Method}
The normalize adjacency matrix of 
a connected graph (for simplicity we use here undirected) is a transition matrix
and represents a
Markov process. On a given time-step, a visitor on a graph node chooses
his next station at random among the neighbours of the current station (node).

We want to know first, if we repeat this process to infinity will the frequency
of the visits at each node stabalize 

\section{Mathematical Primer}
\subsection{Matrix Algebra Primer}

\begin{mydef}
\label{def:transition}
A \textbf{Transition Matrix} is a real valued non negative square ($n^2$) matrix $A$ s.t. each of its
columns sums up to one: $$\forall j \sum_i A_{i,j} = 1,\ \forall i,j A_{i,j} \geq
1$$ 
$A$ acts from the left as a linear mapping:
$T(v) := Av, \forall v \in R^{n}$. In the following script we might
interchangeably and indistinguishably use $T$ (the mapping) or $A$ the matrix.

A transition is \textbf{positive}, designated by $A > 0$ if all its entries are positive.

A transition is \textbf{regular} if for some $k>$ $A^k$ is positive. The same
property is called \textbf{primitive} in some other sources.

A transition is \textbf{irreducible} if for every entry $A_{i,j}$ there is some $k$ such
that $A^k_{i,j} > 0$ (More on that further down).
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}
\label{def:state}
A \textbf{State} is a non-negative vector $v \in R^n$ s.t $\sum_i v_i = 1$.
\end{mydef}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark:state}
If $v$ is a
state and $A$ is a transition as defined in
\ref{def:transition}, then
  $Av$ is also a state because: 
$$\sum_i(Av)_i = \sum_j v_j(\sum_k A_{j,k}) = \sum_j v_j \cdot 1 = 1$$

If $A$ is a transition and $x,y$ are two states such that
$x \leq Ay$ then $x=y$.
\end{remark}

\begin{mydef}
\label{def:abs}
Given $A \in \C^{n \times n}$ We let $|A| \in \C^{n \times n}$ be the resulting
matrix from applying $|\cdot|$ element wise. Given a vector $v \in \C^n$ we let
$|v| \in \C^n$ the corresponding non-negative vector.

We also let $A \gt 0, v \gt 0$ mean that it holds coordinate wise. 
\end{mydef}

Here is a very useful lemma for non-negative matrices which we will need later:
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:eqal_by_vector}
Let $0 \leq A \leq B \in \R^{n \times n}$ 
and let $0 \lt v \in \R^n$.
If $Av = Bv$ then $A = B$.
\begin{proof}
Trivial.
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark:abs}
If $u \in \C^n$ is on the unit circle and $T$ a transition then
$|u|$ is a transition, meaning $\||u|\|=1$, so $T|u|$ is also a transition
so $\|T|u|\|=1$.

We have (component-wise) $|Tu| \leq T|u|$. If $T>0$ and $u$ has negative or
non-real entries, then this inequality must be strict and
then $\|Tu\| \lt \|T|u|\| = 1$.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:exist1}
If $T$ is a transition, then
there is a state $u$ such that $Tu = u$.
\begin{proof}
Because the columns of $A$ all sum to $1$, the columns of $A-I$ all sum to $0$.
Therefore $(1,1, \dots, 1)$ is an (left) eigenvector of the rows with eigenvalue $1$.
Therefore there is also some real (right) column eigenvector with eigenvalue $1$. 
(Also it follows from the Brouer fixed point theorem because $T$ maps the $l_1$
sphere to itself).

Let $u \in R^n$ be such vector: $Au=u$. Let $u = u^+ + u^-$ such that $u^- =
\min(u_i,0)$ and the other one defined similarly for the non-negative components.

Because $A$ is non-negative $A(u^+) \geq (Au)^+ \geq 0$,
and $A(u^-) \leq (Au)^- \leq 0$.

From $A$ being
non-negative and $(Au)^+ + (Au)^- = Au = u = u^+ + u^-$
And also $(A u)^+ = (u)^+$, so we must have $Au^+ \geq (Au)^+ = u^+$ 
(component wise). But if we had a strict inequality we would get:
$\|A(u^+/\|u^+\|_1)\|_1 > 1$ which is a contradiction to $A$ being a transition
matrix.

Then $A u^+ = u^+, A u^- = u^-$ and one of them must be non-zero. It follows
that $A$ has a non-negative eigenvector with eigenvalue $1$ (one of $u^+, -u^-$
which is non-zero). If we $l_1$-normalize that eigenvector it becomes a state.
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}


\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:uniq1}
If a transition $A \gt 0$ (or primitive)
, then it has exactly
one eigenvector $v$ with eigenvalue $1$ and in addition it can be chosen so that $v > 0$
Any for any other eigenvalue
$\lambda$ it holds that $|\lambda| \lt 1$.

If $A$ is just irreducible then then again $v>0$ and is unique but there may be
additional eigenvalues on the unit circle.

\begin{proof}
Let $A \gt 0$ be a transition. We already know that there exists at least one such eigenvector.
Let $u,v$ s.t $Au=u, Av=v$. 
We can assume these are real vectors because $A$ has only real entries.
Therefore we can choose $u,v$
to be states as we have already proven above.

Then let $w=u-v$. So $Aw = A(u-v) = u-v = w$. 
And $\sum_i w_i = 1 - 1 = 0$ by choice of $u,v$.

Like before $Aw^+ = w^+, Aw^- = w^-$
and because $w \neq 0$ but sums up to $0$, both $w^+, -w^- > 0$.
Because $w^-$ is non zero exactly on entries where $w^+$ is zero and vice versa, 
each of them must have at least one $0$ entry (and one none zero). But because
$A$ is strictly positive and $w^+$ is non-negative, $Aw^+$ must have ONLY
positive entries, contradicting $Aw^+ = w^+$. It follows then that $u-v=0$ is
the only possibility, hence the eigenvector with $1$ as eigenvalue is unique.

Suppose there is $Aw = \lambda w$ where $| \lambda|=1$. Choose $w$ so it is
$l_1$-normalized. Then $|w| = |Aw| \leq A \cdot |w|$ If $w$ has any negative or
complex coordinantes, then $|Aw| \lt A|w|$ and therefore 
$1 = \| |Aw| \|_1 \lt \|A|w|\|_1 =1$, a contradiction. Therefore there cannot be
any other eigenvalues on the unit circle.

Extending this for primitive matrix is easy because for some sufficiently big
$k$ $A^k \gt 0$. 

To prove the uniqueness of the $1$-eigenvector for the irreducible case, we have
$(\forall k \in \N) A^kw^+ = w^+$ and from that with some more work left undone
it follows that $w^+ > 0$ or
$w^+ = 0$.
\qedsymbol

\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
\label{remark:rhoisone}
The lemmas and theorems in this section are phrased in term of transitions. They
hold true almost verbatim in the more general case of positive/non-negative
linear transformations.

In general a non-negative linear transformation has a \textbf{spectral radius}
$\rho = \rho(A)$ which is the absolute value of its greatest eigenvalue. In the case of
positive maps there is a unique single eigenvector with $\rho$ as the unique
greatest eigenvalue and so forth \dots. When we deal with a transition map,
lemma \ref{lem:uniq1} guaranties 
it has a spectral value of $\rho(A) = 1$.
\end{remark}

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:transition_ev}
Let $T$ be a positive (or primitive) transition. Then 

1. $1$ is the greatest eigenvalue
of $T$ and it has one unique eigenvector which is also positive,
so there exists a unique stationary state.

2. All the other eigenvalues have absolute value strictly less than $1$.

3. For every state $u$, $T^ku$ converges to the stationary state $\pi$.
In particular the columns of $T$ converge to $\pi$.

\begin{proof}
1 and 2. We already know.

3. There is a Jordan decomposition $T = PJP^{-1}$.Such that $J$ is a Jordan
matrix, $j_{1,1} = 1$ and the rest of the main diagonal $|J_{i,i}| <1$.
So now the convergence is clear $J^k \to (e_1 | 0 \dots | 0)$.
For the matrix $P$ it must hold that $P = (P_1, \dots, P_n)$ and $P_1$ is the
eigenvector of $T$ corresponding to $1$ which we are free to $l_1$ normalize 
and the first row of $P^{-1}$ is the
left eigenvector corresponding to $1$ and so force \dots.

Some more work or literature check should confirm that $T^k \to (v|v\dots|v) = V$.
Then one can verify $Vu = v$ for any state $u$.
\end{proof}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:transition_irr_ev}
Let $T$ be an irreducible positive (or primitive) transition. 
Then:

1. Then $1$ is the greatest eigenvalue
of $T$ and it has one unique eigenvector which is also positive,
so there exists a unique stationary state.

2. If there are other other eigenvalues on the unit circle then their algebaic
multiplicity is equal their geometric multiplicity.

3. For every state $u$, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n T^ku$ converges to the stationary state $\pi$.
In particular the columns of $T$ converge to $\pi$.

\begin{proof}
1 We already know.

2. There is a Jordan decomposition $T = PJP^{-1}$. such that $J$ is a Jordan
matrix, $j_{1,1} = 1$ and the rest of the main diagonal $|J_{i,i}| \leq 1$.

If we had a Jordan block of size greater than $1$ for an eigenvalue $\lambda$,
Then on the superdiagonal of $J^k$ we would have $k \lambda$. If $\lambda =1$
then $J^k$ and hence $T^k$ would be unbounded, but that is impossible since
$T^k$ is a transition. If follows that all eigenvalues on the unit circle must
be simple (alebgaic multiplicity equals geometric).

3. For the convergence, it follows from calculations on the Jordan blocks, which
I omit. See \textcite{meyer2000matrix} for rigorous proof.
\end{proof}
\end{thm}


What differs irreducible non-primitive matrices from being primitiv is
that they are periodical on their complex eigenvectors with complex eigenvalues
on the unit cycle. There is, in fact a wonderful theorem from Wielandt which
characterizes these Matrices:

\begin{thm}[Wielandt (1950)]
\label{thm:wielandt}
Let $A,B \in \C^{n \times n}$ such that $A \geq 0$ is irreducible and $|B| \leq
A$ (component-wise). Then $\rho(B) \leq \rho(A)$.
If $\rho(B)=\rho(A)$ then $|B|=A$, $B$ has an eigenvalue of the form $\mu =
\rho(A)e^{i \phi}$ and:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:wielandt1}
B &= 
e^{i \phi}DAD^{-1} \\ 
\text{where } D \text{ has the form:}\\
D &= 
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{\theta_1} & & & \\
& e^{\theta_2} & & \\
& & \ddots & \\
& & & e^{\theta_2}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

And conversely any $B$ of the form \ref{eq:wielandt1}
has $\rho(B) = \rho(A)$, $|B|=A$ and $\mu$ is an eigenvalue of $B$ which
corresponds to the eigenvalue $\rho(A)=|\mu|$ the greatest eigenvalue of $A$.

\begin{proof}
To see a rigorous proof I suggest \textcite{meyer2000matrix}.

The keys for proving this theorem are:
First WLG assume $A$ is a transition. This is possible because we may replace $A$ with $W^{-1}A$, and $B$ with
$W^{-1}B$, where $W$ is the diagonal matrix that has the column-sums of $A$.
Since $A$ is irreducible it cannot have a column or a row that is all $0$
so this diagonal is positive $W$ is indeed invertible and later we can cancel out the
$W$'s and return to the general case.

Let $v$ be the $\mu$-eigenvector $Bv = \mu v, \|\mu|=1$ and choose it so that 
$\|v\|_1=1$.

Then 
\begin{equation}
|v| = |\mu v| = |B v| \leq |B| |v|
\leq A |v|
\end{equation}

Since $A$ is a transition by remark \ref{remark:state} $A|v|=|v|$. Since $A$ is
irreducible and $A|v| = |v|$ we must have by \ref{thm:transition_irr_ev} that
$|v| \gt 0$, and then by
lemma \ref{lem:eqal_by_vector} $A = |B|$ so that proves the first part.  

Now let $w = v / |v|$ (component-wise division) and let 
\[D = \text{diag}(w) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{\theta_1} & & & \\
& e^{\theta_2} & & \\
& & \ddots & \\
& & & e^{\theta_2}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Then $v = D|v|$, $|v|=D^{-1}v$ and we have:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wielandt1proof}
\begin{aligned}
A|v| &= |v| = D^{-1}v = \\
&= D^{-1} \mu^{-1} B v = \mu^{-1} D^{-1} BD|v|
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We know already that $|v| \gt 0$. If 
$C := \mu^{-1} D^{-1} BD$ contains any negative or complex entries, then
\ref{eq:wielandt1proof} cannot hold. It follows that
\[
A = C = \mu^{-1} D^{-1} BD 
\]

This proves the harder direction of the claim, the other direction is easy \qedsymbol.

\end{proof}
\end{thm}

The amazing consequence from \ref{thm:wielandt}:

\begin{thm}[Corollarly]
\label{thm:wielandt2}
If $A$ is irreducible transition with $h$ 
eigenvalues on the unit circle then its eigenvalues are exactly the $h$th unit roots
$\lambda_k = e^{2 \pi i k /h}, k = 0 \dots n-1$ and $A$ is similar to $\lambda
A$ by a diagonal matrix for any such eigenvalue.

\begin{proof}
Use theorem \ref{thm:wielandt} with $B=A$. If $|\lambda|=1$ is an eigenvalue
then $A = \lambda D A D^{-1}$. Since similarity doesn't change the eigenvalues,
$A$ and $\lambda A$ must have the same eigenvalues with the same multiplicity.
Since $1$ is a simple eigenvalue of $A$ and hence of $\lambda A$, and its
corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda$ is simple in $\lambda A$ and therefore in $A$
as well.

The matrices $\lambda_k A$, $k=0 \dots h$ are all similar, with $\lambda_0 = 1$
and $|\lambda_k| = 1, k=0 \dot h-1$ all simple eigenvalues. The only way for this to hold is if
$\{\lambda_k\}_0^{h-1}$ form a multiplicative group of order $h$ on the unit
circle, in other words, the eigenvalues are exactly all the $h$th unit roots. 
\end{proof}
\end{thm}

Now we will just present the Perron-Frobenius theorems. The main parts that are
important to our work have appeared in the previous theorems.

\begin{thm}[Perron-Frobenius \cite{meyer2000matrix}]
\label{perron1}


Let $0 \lt A \in \R^{n \times n}$ with spectral radius $\rho := \rho(A)$, then the following are all true:
\begin{itemize}
\item{} $\rho \gt 0$
\item{} $\rho$ is a simple root of the characteristic polynomial of $A$,
in other words its algebraic multiplicity is $1$.
\item{} $(\exists v > 0) Av=\rho v$
\item{} If $Au = \lambda u$ and $\|u\|= \rho$ then $\lambda = \rho$
namely, $\rho$ is the unique eigenvalue on the spectral circle.
\item{(Collatz-Wielandt Formula)} $\rho = \max_{x \in \Gamma} \min_{i : x_i \neq 0} [Ax]_i / x_i$
with $\Gamma = \{x | x \geq 0, x \neq 0\}$
\end{itemize}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}[Perron-Frobenius for irreducible matrices \autocite{meyer2000matrix}]
\label{perron2}

Let $0 \leq A \in \R^{n \times n}$ be irreducible with spectral radius $\rho := \rho(A)$,
then the following are all true:
\begin{itemize}
\item{} $\rho \gt 0$
\item{} $\rho$ is a simple root of the characteristic polynomial of $A$,
in other words its algebraic multiplicity is $1$.
\item{} $(\exists v > 0) Av=\rho v$
\item{} There are no additional non-negative unit eigenvectors of $A$ other than
$v$. 
\item{(Collatz-Wielandt Formula)} $\rho = \max_{x \in \Gamma} \min_{i : x_i \neq 0} [Ax]_i / x_i$
with $\Gamma = \{x | x \geq 0, x \neq 0\}$
\end{itemize}
