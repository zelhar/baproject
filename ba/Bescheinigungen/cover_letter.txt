To whom it may concern,

I am currently finishing my bachelors degree for bioinformatics at
the FU Berlin and would like to continue with the masters program.

The only remaining item to complete my bachelors degree is the
bachelors thesis, which I have just started with professor
Martin Vingron as my advisor and should complete by 30.09.2020.

Please note that I have finished the course "Algoritmische
Bioninformatik" in WS19/20, which is required for this application.
While I have passed the course, the grades are not yet available in
an official transcript.

Since I would transition within FU Berlin I attached the two
documents required for this application according to my department:

1. "Zweidrittelbescheinigung" 
2. "High School Diploma", which substantiates
    5 units (extended subject) of English studies which
    in Israel is for 8 years.  

Please don't hesitate to let me know if additional
documents are required.

Kind regards,
